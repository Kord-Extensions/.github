# Code of Conduct

All contributions - whether they're pull requests, issue submissions, comment on issues,
or any other interactions with our community or projects - must follow our Code of Conduct.

All Code of Conduct violations will be approached with the gravity that the specific
situation demands. We are serious about our responsibility to provide a friendly and
inclusive space for our users, and all violations will be dealt with appropriately.

# Introduction

Our Code of Conduct outlines the types of behaviour we expect from member of our community, and forms the basis for our other policies. It's important that everyone making use of any of our services reads over this document, and understands the thought process behind it.

While this document does go into detail on the types of behaviour we encourage (and that we find unacceptable), it's impossible to enumerate every possible situation in a single document. For that reason, there will be situations involving unacceptable behaviour that isn't explicitly mentioned in our policies. We'll still action these problematic forms of behaviour, and we'll update our documentation as needed when these situations arise.

In general, treat others how you wish to be treated - if you wouldn't appreciate being treated in a particular way, don't treat others that way yourself!

When this document is updated, we'll announce it on Discord. If you have any concerns, questions or suggestions relating to our policies, feel free to contact a staff member directly, or send a message to `#kordex-discussion` on the Discord server.

# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and staff members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and we are committed to promoting these concepts.
Our Standards

We expect the members of our community to participate in a positive, authentic and active way. Consideration, respect and empathy are key when it comes to building and supporting a healthy community, and we request that our members exercise this through their actions.

Please take into account that online communities bring together people from many different cultures and backgrounds. It's important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to misunderstandings â€” that is why having empathy is very important.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy, patience and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Threats of violence, or violent acts towards others
* Public or private harassment
* Intentionally dead-naming or misgendering others
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission ("doxing")
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any unacceptable forms of behaviour
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Staff members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a participant engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the staff members of this community may take any action they deem appropriate. Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: expulsion from the community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (both online and offline), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct applies to all projects, repositories and community spaces that are managed by Kord Extensions, regardless of whether or not the use of this code is explicitly called out. We may also enforce the Code of Conduct based on the behaviour exhibited by any individual outside of our community spaces, in order to protect the members of our community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Kord Extensions staff members, directly on Discord. If your report concerns a specific staff member or group of staff members, please send your report to a staff member that is not part of the report.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all staff members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
