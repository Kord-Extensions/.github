# Code of Conduct

All contributions - whether they're pull requests, issue submissions, comment on issues,
or any other interactions with our community or projects - must follow our Code of Conduct.

For the sake of keeping things easy to maintain, we do not include the full Code of Conduct
in our repositories. Instead, please

All Code of Conduct violations will be approached with the gravity that the specific
situation demands. We are serious about our responsibility to provide a friendly and
inclusive space for our users, and all violaters will be dealt with appropriately.
