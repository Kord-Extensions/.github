Kord Extensions is an addon for the excellent [Kord library](https://github.com/kordlib/kord). It intends to provide a
framework for larger bot projects, with easy-to-use commands, rich argument parsing and event handling, wrapped up
into individual extension classes.

The approach taken here is relatively different from a lot of Kotlin libraries, many of which prefer to provide a DSL
for quickly prototyping or implementing a small application. Instead,
[Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) (the Discord library for Python) is a primary source of inspiration
for our fairly object-oriented design, especially where it comes to its extensions (which are known as cogs in
Discord.py). Despite this, we still strive to provide an idiomatic API that makes full use of Kotlin's niceties.

If you're ready to get started, please [take a look at the documentation](https://docs.kordex.dev/).
