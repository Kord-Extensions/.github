Hello, and thanks for submitting a question! To help us address this issue
quickly, please take the time to fill out this issue template to the best of
your ability, and please provide as much information as possible!

When you're done, feel free to remove these comments if you like.

This issue template is freeform, as questions can be about any relevant subject. 
Instead of providing you with headers, we'd like to offer the following tips:

* Be as detailed as possible in your question - detailed questions can often
  be answered more quickly, as we need to ask for fewer clarifications.

* If you have any additional media that goes with your questions (for example,
  screenshots, screen recordings, and so on), please attach them at the bottom
  of your issue.

* Remember that there are only so many hours in the day - we'll get to you as
  soon as we can, but there may be more pressing discussions that need to be
  had before we can address your question. Don't worry, though - we will get
  to it!

* All issues are required to follow our 
  [Code of Conduct](https://kotlindiscord.com/docs/code-of-conduct). If you
  haven't yet read it, we recommend that you do so now.
