# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Our vulnerability disclosure policy is simple: Do not disclose serious vulnerabilities in
public, unless they already have been - by ourselves or **Dependabot**.

You can always contact us directly on Discord. Feel free to send a private message to one
of our admins there. We're happy to address any concerns you may have, and we'd love to 
hear from you if there's an issue that needs fixing.
