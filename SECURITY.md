# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Our vulnerability disclosure policy is simple: Do not disclose serious vulnerabilities in
public, unless they already have been - by ourselves or **Dependabot**.

You can always contact us directly on Discord. Feel free to send a private message to one
of our admins there, or send one to the **ModMail** bot to contact the entire staff team.
We're happy to address any concerns you may have, and we'd love to hear from you if there's
an issue that needs fixing.
